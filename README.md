# java-practice-questions
This repository contains practice questions on the basic concepts of Java 

This repository includes the practice questions on the follwoing topics:)
1)conditional statements-if, if else, if elseif else 
*Conditional statements defines which set of code to be executed by the given condition defined in the program . These statements are also known as decision statements or selection statements in Java.

2)loops - pattern questions based on loops , types of loops
*loops are used for iteration 

3)exceptions handling- try catch 
*The Exception Handling in Java is one of the powerful mechanism to handle the runtime errors so that the normal flow of the application can be maintained. in general Exception is an abnormal condition.
some of exceptions in java are: Arithmetic Exception , Nullpointer exception, ArrayIndexOutOfBound exception etc. ,to handle such kinds of exceptions we use try catch statements in java .

4) String handling in Java:  Strings are a sequence of characters. In Java programming language, strings are treated as objects.

5)Arrays- arrays are used to store similar type of data , we can define arrays one dimensionally or multi dimensionally(2-D,3-D)

6)sorting --  sorting of array means that arranging the array elements in an specified order, i.e ascending or descending.
several types of sorting are shell sort, bubble sort,selection sort etc.
Selection sort- the basic idea of selection sort is to repeatedly select the smallest key in the remaining unsorted array.
Bubble sort- Basic idea of bubble sorting is to compare the adjacent values and exchange them if they are not in proper order.

7)ArrayList- we can say ArrayList is a dynamic type of array i.e resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package.
difference between Array and ArrayList is we can modify the size of array in ArrayList but can't in Array declaration.
